// When user loads page, all HTML appears and computer chooses a random letter
// If user types a letter, then display the letter in the 'Your Guesses So Far' row
// If letterGuessed is the same as letterGenerated, then Wins counter increases by 1
// If letterGuessed is different from the letterGenerated, then 
// When the player wins, increase the Wins counter and start the game over again (without refreshing the page).
// When the player loses, increase the Losses counter and restart the game without a page refresh (just like when the user wins).
