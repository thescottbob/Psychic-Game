# Psychic-Game
JavaScript HW 3.2

This game is partially coded, and the remaining aspects are pseudocoded. The game works by guessing letters to try to match the randomly generated letter the computer thought of. If you can get it in 9 attempts, you win the round! Otherwise, your Psychic skills require further honing.
